    question: "What are the main differences between REST and GraphQL?",
    answer: "<p>REST: Fixed endpoints, potential over-fetching/under-fetching, requires versioning, uses standard HTTP methods, and has predefined responses. GraphQL: Flexible queries, avoids over-fetching/under-fetching, typically no versioning, uses a single endpoint for requests, and allows clients to define response structures.</p>",
  },
  {
    id: "O49",
    question: "Different options for embedding images and fonts on the site.",
    answer: "<p>REST: Uses multiple endpoints for different resources and returns fixed data structures. It can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching of data. Uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure (e.g., 200, 404, 500).</p><p>GraphQL: Allows clients to request exactly the data they need from a single endpoint, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. Returns a 200 status code for all requests, regardless of whether the requested data was found or if an error occurred. Errors are included in the response body.</p>",
  },
  {
    id: "O50",
    question: "What is the purpose of HTTP status codes? Can you give examples of some common ones?",
    answer: "<p>HTTP status codes indicate the result of a server's request.<p><p><ul><li>5xx - Internal Server Error</li><li>4xx - client error</li><li>3xx - redirection</li><li>2xx - success</li><li>1xx - informational</li></ul></p>",

  {
    id: "O51",
    question: "What is the concept of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)? Why is it important?",

  {
    id: "O54",
    question: "What are the differences between synchronous and asynchronous requests in web development?",

  },
  {
    id: "O55",
    question: "What is throttling and debouncing, and when would you use them?",
    answer: "<p>Throttling limits how often a function can be called (e.g., every 100ms), while debouncing ensures a function is called only after a specified time has passed since the last call (e.g., after 300ms of inactivity). They help optimize performance in scenarios like scroll or resize events.</p>",

  },
  {
    id: "O62",
    question: "What is the purpose of server-side caching, and how does it improve performance?",
